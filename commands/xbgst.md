# /xbgst — Godspeed Pareto + Cross-Model Delegation

The full crossbreed: godspeed Pareto walk (parallel proposals, axis-scored, round-capped) with cross-model delegation (teammates invoke `xask codex`). Combines the speed of `/xgs` with the external perspectives of `/xbt`.

Use when you want fast Pareto convergence AND cross-model views. For all-Claude speed without cross-model, use `/xgs`. For slower deliberative mediation with cross-model, use `/xbt`.

## Step 1 — Load the judge persona

Read `~/.claude/agents/the-judge.md` with the Read tool. Adopt the posture: judge explicitly on named axes, aggregate best-of-each, draft-then-dispatch.

## Step 2 — Create the team

Pick a concise unique `team_name`:
- First 2-3 significant words of prompt (lowercased, hyphen-joined) + timestamp suffix
- Fallback: `xbgst-squad-<ts>`

```
TeamCreate(
  team_name="<your-unique-name>",
  agent_type="team-lead",
  description="<the full user prompt, truncated to 200 chars>"
)
```

**Pre-flight hardening:** run once before create:

```bash
xbreed precheck pane-cap --team-size 12
```

If this check fails, stop and report the limit instead of attempting the team launch.

If `TeamCreate` fails because a team already exists, auto-cleanup: shutdown idle teammates + TeamDelete + retry. Do not ask the user.

## Scratch working directory (team cwd)

Judge-orchestrated runs work in an isolated **scratch checkout**, NOT per-agent git worktrees. Before spawning teammates, create it and `cd` in:

```bash
ORIGIN_URL=$(git remote get-url origin)
SCRATCH=$(mktemp -d "/tmp/xbgst-XXXXXX")
git clone --no-hardlinks . "$SCRATCH"
cd "$SCRATCH" && git remote set-url origin "$ORIGIN_URL"
git checkout -b "xbgst/<topic>-<ts>"
```

All teammates operate inside `$SCRATCH`. Do NOT spawn agents with `isolation: "worktree"`.

**Model routing (locked):** the judge (this session) runs on Fable 5; every dispatched teammate runs on Sonnet (`model: "sonnet"`) — the intermediary that delegates to codex. Codex delegations through xask are unchanged.

## Step 3 — Parse the prompt

$ARGUMENTS

If empty, wait for user direction. Otherwise, proceed to four-phase godspeed with xask.

**Pre-flight expectation:** `/xbgst` runs on an already-scoped prompt. If the user's intent is unclear, design-shaped, or pre-specification, point them to the Superpowers `brainstorming` skill first — that HARD-GATE produces the approved spec that becomes `/xbgst`'s input. Inside the walk, clarifying questions are suppressed (godspeed); ambiguity must be resolved upstream. This is guidance, not a prerequisite — the judge may still proceed on a rough prompt when the axes are self-evident.

## Step 4 — Four-phase godspeed protocol (with xask gate)

### Phase 0 — Spawn the-planner, then name the axes

**Planner-first is unconditional.** Per `~/.claude/agents/the-judge.md` sub-role dispatch table and `commands/references/xbreed-shared.md` Axis → Profile Mapping, `the-planner` is "spawned FIRST at Phase 0 by the-judge to map skeleton before specialist dispatch" — not conditional on the user typing `/wwkd`. Spawn `the-planner` BEFORE naming axes:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="the-planner",
  team_name="<team>",
  name="ccs-planner-r0",
  model="sonnet",
  prompt="WWKD Phase 0 data walk + skeleton plan for: <full user prompt>. Your FIRST tool call MUST be Skill(skill='wwkd') — Layer 0. Deliver plan artifact to team-lead when done. | godspeed"
)
```

Wait for the plan artifact. It becomes the **Phase 0 baseline** — axis naming (Phase 1) and specialist dispatch (Phase 2) check for drift against it. If a Phase 1 axis contradicts the planner's skeleton, flag it in the round summary.

Once the planner returns, emit up to 8 axes (name + direction + observable). Incorporate user-named axes; infer the rest.

Composition: `/xbgst /wwkd <spec>` is the explicit form of the same behavior — the orchestrator runs identically whether or not the user prefixes with `/wwkd`.

### Phase 1 — Assign deterministic teammate names

For each axis, assign a name: `{prefix}-{role}-{suffix}`. Commit ALL names before spawning.

Axis → profile mapping (see `~/.claude/commands/references/xbreed-shared.md` for full details). All teammates run **sonnet medium** uniformly (2026-04-17 pivot — supersedes earlier opus-medium unified scheme; only `the-judge` itself stays fable-**high** for orchestrator depth, downgraded from xhigh 2026-04-19):
- Research, prior art → `scout` — `xask --effort medium --gs codex`
- Correctness, bugs → `reviewer` — `xask --gpt55 --gs -e low codex`
- Empirical probes → `labrat` — `xask --spark --gs codex`
- Code execution → `executor` — `xask --spark --gs codex`
- Cross-axis patterns → `connector` — `xask --effort medium codex`
- Synthesis, dedup → `distiller` — in-session
- Complexity reduction → `simplifier` — CC native

Cap: <=12 teammates per round.

### Phase 2 — Spawn all with full peer roster AND xask gate

Each brief includes:
1. Full peer roster (all names from Phase 1)
2. Axis assignment
3. **Godspeed marker — purest form:** append ` | godspeed` (literal, with leading space) to the prompt. No preamble, no explanation block. The single-token marker is the whole directive — sonnet-medium teammates read it as "iterate cheap in parallel, no clarifying questions, no verbose plans, act via tool calls". Any teammate who needs more than that is the wrong role for the lane.
4. **Structural xask gate — verbatim Layer-1 string per role (MANDATORY inline, NOT via pointer).** Paste the exact per-role gate string into the teammate brief. Indirection ("Read shared.md and apply") is lossy — teammates skip the gate when the string is not physically present. The table below is the source-of-truth; mirror from `xbreed-shared.md §xask Gate (4 layers)` if either drifts.

| Role | Verbatim Layer-1 string to include in brief |
|---|---|
| `scout` | `Your FIRST tool call MUST be Bash: xask --effort medium --gs codex '<research question>'. No other tool before xask returns.` |
| `reviewer` | `Your FIRST tool call MUST be Bash: xask --gpt55 --gs -e low codex '<review question>'. No other tool before xask returns.` |
| `labrat` | `Your FIRST tool call MUST be Bash: xask --spark --gs codex '<probe hypothesis>'. No other tool before xask returns.` |
| `executor` | `Your FIRST tool call MUST be Bash: xask --spark --gs codex '<task>'. No other tool before xask returns.` |
| `connector` | `Your FIRST tool call MUST be Bash: xask --effort medium codex '<pattern question>'. No other tool before xask returns.` |
| `the-revenger` | `Your FIRST tool call MUST be Bash: xask --gpt55 --gs -e high codex '<RECON / surface enumeration question>'. No other tool before xask returns.` |
| `sentinel` | `Your FIRST tool call MUST be Bash: xask --gpt55 --gs -e low codex '<exploit/vulnerability analysis question>'. No other tool before xask returns.` |
| `critic` | `Your FIRST tool call MUST be Skill(skill='heuer-planning') — this is Layer 0. After the skill loads, your SECOND tool call MUST be Bash: xask --gpt55 --gs -e low codex '<design review question>'. No other tool before xask returns.` |
| `mutation-tester` | `Your FIRST tool call MUST be Bash, EITHER (a) xask --spark --gs codex '<generate mutation>' for ≤4 targets OR (b) xask --effort high --gs codex '<generate N mutations of <fn>; vary angle>' for ≥5 targets. No other tool before xask returns.` |
| `the-planner` | `Your FIRST tool call MUST be Skill(skill='wwkd') — this is Layer 0. NO Layer-1 xask gate.` |
| `simplifier`/`distiller`/`scribe` | No xask gate, no Layer 0 skill load. |

Also include Layers 2–4 verbatim in each brief (raw-quote gate, fallback, confidence) per `xbreed-shared.md §xask Gate (4 layers)`.

5. Task: propose ONE move (<=200 words) **with a structured `evidence:` field** (see Evidence Schema in `xbreed-shared.md`)
6. After proposing, DM each peer with one-line critique
7. Mark task completed

**Executor lane — ` | godspeed-impl` suffix variant:** when spawning `executor` teammates, append ` | godspeed-impl` instead of ` | godspeed`. The `-impl` suffix alone signals red-before-green evidence discipline to the executor — no preamble needed. Non-executable axes are not eligible for the executor lane (by role, not by directive).

#### Pre-dispatch self-check (MANDATORY)

Before invoking Agent() for any teammate, the judge MUST grep-verify the brief contains the exact substring `"FIRST tool call MUST be Bash: xask"` (or the critic/planner Layer-0 variant). If grep returns zero hits, the brief is gateless — do NOT dispatch; regenerate. Rationale: xask-gate-regress-0420 R1 confirmed that 128e724's "Read shared.md and apply" indirection silently dropped the Layer-1 gate in ~all briefs, degrading protocol across rounds.

#### xask gate, epistemic constraints

The table above is the extract every judge needs inline. For epistemic constraints (AT-MOST-one-claim + divergence mandate), Layer 2/3/4 mechanics, and axis → profile mapping, see `~/.claude/commands/references/xbreed-shared.md`.

Create TaskCreate per teammate.

### Phase 3 — Rounds begin

**Distiller synthesis:** Once all teammates have spawned, spawn the distiller:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="distiller",
  team_name="<team>",
  name="ccs-distiller",
  model="sonnet",
  prompt="You are the distiller. Synthesize these N teammate proposals and peer critiques into one deduplicated, confidence-scored brief. <paste all proposals + DM critiques>. Deduplicate overlapping moves, flag cross-model contradictions (codex vs claude), assign confidence. DO NOT rewrite, summarize, or absorb any line beginning with `evidence:` — copy it verbatim, byte-for-byte, into the corresponding move in your synthesis output. This is a structural requirement, not guidance; the Pareto filter reads the field post-synthesis. SendMessage your synthesis to the judge (team lead) when done. |godspeed"
)
```

**Pareto filter (on distiller output):** Accept strict improvers, reject regressions. Compile ROUND N summary.

Every surviving move must carry a structured `evidence:` field matching the **Pareto Filter Evidence Schema** in `xbreed-shared.md`. Moves lacking the required form (e.g., executor-lane proposal with no failing/passing test output) are **dropped, not scored**. Distiller passes the field through verbatim — do not prose-absorb. Non-executable axes use the negative convention: `evidence: none — <axis reason>`.

**Re-distill each round:** For rounds 2+, send updated proposals to the distiller via SendMessage. Only re-spawn if shut down.

**CONFLICTS block** uses **model labels**:
```
CONFLICTS (emit only if cross-model contradictions exist):
  - claim: <contested fact>
    model: codex (via <teammate>) — <position>
    model: claude (via <teammate>) — <position>
    judge_resolution: <chosen + rationale>
    escalate_to: <sub-role if unresolved>
```

**Falsification probe:** After Pareto filter, if highest-divergence surviving move has an unchallenged claim, dispatch ONE targeted xask to opposing model. Cap: one exchange, one claim (3-8s).

**Judge weighting:** Weight xask quotes that contradict agent's conclusion more heavily than confirming quotes.

**Exit condition:** see the **Exit Condition (strict)** section in `xbreed-shared.md` — including the materiality rule (axis-observable change, not prose delta) and the anti-premature-halt steps. Round 1 by construction moves axes off baseline, so Round 2 always runs unless capped.

## Step 5 — Keep iterating

Do not pause. Do not ask. User interrupts to steer. Keep iterating.

Caps: <=4 rounds, <=12 teammates, <=200-word proposals. Exit semantics live in `xbreed-shared.md`.

## Step 6 — Auto-cleanup after frontier

When the frontier stops moving (zero survivors / duplicates / 4 rounds / user halt): emit final DRAFT, then immediately shutdown all teammates in parallel via `SendMessage shutdown_request`, wait for shutdown_approved, then `TeamDelete`. If TeamDelete fails with "active members", run `xbreed-cleanup <team-name>` via Bash. Do not ask — kill it. User re-invokes `/xbgst` if they want a new axis.

## Terminal step — commit + push (mandatory)

When the frontier is reached (or the run completes), the judge's LAST act is to commit and push from the scratch dir, then discard it:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "xbgst: <one-line summary of the frontier result>"
git push -u origin "xbgst/<topic>-<ts>"
cd - >/dev/null && rm -rf "$SCRATCH"
```

The orchestration ends with a pushed branch — not a dirty tree the user has to clean up.

## Step 7 — Status after init

Emit: team name, axes, teammates + xask targets, waiting on Round N.
Immediately compile and dispatch when findings arrive.
